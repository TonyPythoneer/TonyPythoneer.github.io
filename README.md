## DefinitelyTyped

I consider `TypeSript` is the most useful transpiler in JS. It's a strict superset of JavaScript because it offers not only `ES6/ES7` but also `typed`. Personlly, it's very better than `Babel`.

But it's diffcult to evangelize developers, I am in order to prove that I love TypeSript. Therefore, I start to contribute `DefinitelyTyped` to improve defintion.

My Contributions:
  * Maintain nodejs defintion
  * Create pug defintion
