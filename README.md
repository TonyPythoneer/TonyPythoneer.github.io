## DefinitelyTyped

I consider `TypeSript` is the most useful transpiler in JS. It's a strict superset of JavaScript because it offers not only `ES6/ES7` but also `typed`. Personlly, it's very better than `Babel`.

But it's diffcult to evangelize developers, I am in order to prove that I love TypeSript. Therefore, I start to contribute `DefinitelyTyped` to improve defintion.

My Contributions:
  * [Maintain nodejs defintion](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%5Bnode%5D%20in%3Atitle%20is%3Amerged%20is%3Apr%20author%3ATonyPythoneer%20)
  * [Create pug defintion](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/11258)
